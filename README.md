# VSTranspiler
Visual Scripting Transpiler

#### Version alpha-1.0

## Motivation
The way programming has been done since the beginning has always been text-based
<s>(yeah I know... punched cards, etc. Anyway, I needed an introduction)</s>.
A new kind of programming has been created which is called _Visual Programming_.
I've always been interested in this kind of thinking, being detached from the text-based
way of coding and not learning about all the fancy syntax to get thing done but instead
thinking about our program in itself and being focused on the most important thing: Programming.

This new project has been launched in 2016. However, I was focused on the GUI instead of building
the true valuable product, the "behind the scene" algorithm which will allow to code in any
programming language. Finally, 2 years later I started this project to truly build this program
and let people program without being forced to learn all the syntax and instead being able to express
themselves in any programming languages.

I know... You will say, "The true developers don't have trouble learning syntax!". I was also like
you before. Nonetheless, I know how much time it can take to truly be used to code in a specific
language. I hope, somehow, developers will be good enough to create a program in any language
for any purpose. However, sometimes you start a project and you discover several months later (sometime 
days... sometime weeks) that the programming language you used is not fitted to your
purpose... Yes. That's why I've been dreaming about this project so long. Now, I want to stop dreaming
and start using it!
